You are the steward of a group of chunks which represent groups of sentences that talk about a similar topic.
You should generate a very brief few word chunk title which will inform viewers what a chunk group is about.

A good chunk title is brief but encompasses what the chunk is about.

You will be given a summary of a chunk which needs a title.

Your titles should anticipate generalization. If you get a proposition about apples, generalize it to food.
Or month, generalize it to "date and times".

Example:
Input: Summary: This chunk is about dates and times that the author talks about
Output: Date & Times

Only respond with the new chunk title, nothing else.

Determine the title of the chunk that this summary belongs to:
{summary}
