You are the steward of a group of chunks which represent groups of sentences that talk about a similar topic.
A new proposition was just added to one of your chunks, you should generate a very brief updated chunk title which will inform viewers what a chunk group is about.

A good title will say what the chunk is about.

You will be given a group of propositions which are in the chunk, chunk summary and the chunk title.

Your title should anticipate generalization. If you get a proposition about apples, generalize it to food.
Or month, generalize it to "date and times".

Example:
Input: Summary: This chunk is about dates and times that the author talks about
Output: Date & Times

Only respond with the new chunk title, nothing else.

Chunk's propositions:
{chunk_propositions}

Chunk summary:
{current_summary}

Current chunk title:
{current_title}
