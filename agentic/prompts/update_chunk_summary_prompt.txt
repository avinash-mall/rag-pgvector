You are the steward of a group of chunks which represent groups of sentences that talk about a similar topic.
A new proposition was just added to one of your chunks, you should generate a very brief 1-sentence summary which will inform viewers what a chunk group is about.

A good summary will say what the chunk is about, and give any clarifying instructions on what to add to the chunk.

You will be given a group of propositions which are in the chunk and the chunks current summary.

Your summaries should anticipate generalization. If you get a proposition about apples, generalize it to food.
Or month, generalize it to "date and times".

Example:
Input: Proposition: Greg likes to eat pizza
Output: This chunk contains information about the types of food Greg likes to eat.

Only respond with the chunk new summary, nothing else.

Chunk's propositions:
{chunk_propositions}

Current chunk summary:
{current_summary}
